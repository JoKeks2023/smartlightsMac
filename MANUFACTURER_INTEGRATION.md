# Smart Light Manufacturer Integration Guide

## 🌟 Overview

This document explains how different smart light manufacturers can be integrated with Govee Mac, including **Philips Hue**, LIFX, Nanoleaf, TP-Link Kasa, WLED, and others.

## ✅ Currently Supported Integration Methods

### 1. **Native Protocol Support** (⭐ NEW!)
The app now includes native protocol support for several manufacturers with direct local network control:

#### Supported via Native Protocols:
- ✅ **Philips Hue** - Bridge discovery and link-button pairing (Settings →
  Philips Hue → Find Hue Bridges), then full light control. Build/test-
  verified 2026-09-18; not yet confirmed against a real bridge.
- ✅ **WLED** - Direct REST API control for WLED controllers, once a device
  is found via LAN discovery
- ❌ **LIFX** - Not implemented. `LIFXControl` exists as a stub and throws
  "not implemented" for every call. Use HomeKit or Home Assistant for LIFX.

_(Corrected 2026-09-17, updated 2026-09-18 against the actual code — see
`docs/tasks/T-0001_generaluberholung/`.)_

#### How it Works:
- **Automatic Discovery**: Discovers Hue Bridges, WLED controllers, and LIFX lights via mDNS/Bonjour
- **Direct Control**: No additional hubs or servers required
- **Fast Response**: Local network communication for instant control

#### Setup:
1. Ensure devices are on the same network as your Mac
2. Open Govee Mac and click Refresh
3. Discovered devices appear with respective badges (Hue, WLED, LIFX)

**Note:** Philips Hue Bridge requires API key registration (press link button during first use)

---

### 2. **HomeKit/Matter Integration** (Recommended for maximum compatibility)
The app already includes native HomeKit support, which works with **any** HomeKit-compatible smart light:

#### Supported Manufacturers via HomeKit:
- ✅ **Philips Hue** (if connected to HomeKit)
- ✅ LIFX
- ✅ Nanoleaf
- ✅ Eve Light
- ✅ Meross
- ✅ Govee (Matter-compatible models)
- ✅ Any other HomeKit-compatible smart lights

#### How to Enable:
1. **Add your lights to Apple Home** first:
   - Open Home app on macOS/iOS
   - Add your Philips Hue Bridge (or other lights)
   - Follow manufacturer setup instructions

2. **Enable HomeKit in Govee Mac**:
   - Open Govee Mac app
   - Go to Settings (⌘,)
   - Toggle "Enable HomeKit (Matter)"
   - Grant permission when prompted
   - Your HomeKit lights will appear with "HomeKit" badge

#### Advantages:
- ✅ Native Apple integration
- ✅ Secure and reliable
- ✅ No additional API keys needed
- ✅ Works with all HomeKit accessories
- ✅ Local network control (fast response)

#### Limitations:
- ⚠️ Requires devices to be HomeKit-compatible
- ⚠️ Must be set up in Home app first

---

### 3. **Home Assistant Integration** (Universal Solution)
For the most flexibility, use Home Assistant as a universal bridge:

#### Supported Manufacturers via Home Assistant:
- ✅ **Philips Hue** (via Hue integration)
- ✅ LIFX
- ✅ TP-Link Kasa/Tapo
- ✅ Nanoleaf
- ✅ Yeelight
- ✅ WLED
- ✅ Tuya/Smart Life
- ✅ Govee
- ✅ Zigbee lights (via Zigbee2MQTT, ZHA)
- ✅ Z-Wave lights
- ✅ **100+ other integrations**

#### How to Enable:
1. **Set up Home Assistant**:
   - Install Home Assistant ([hassio.io](https://www.home-assistant.io))
   - Add your lights through HA integrations
   - For Philips Hue: Use the built-in Hue integration

2. **Connect Govee Mac to Home Assistant**:
   - Open Govee Mac Settings
   - Enter your HA Base URL (e.g., `http://homeassistant.local:8123`)
   - Generate a Long-Lived Access Token in HA:
     - Profile → Security → Long-Lived Access Tokens
     - Create token → Copy it
   - Paste token in Govee Mac Settings
   - Devices containing "govee", "hue", "lifx", etc. in friendly name will appear

#### Advantages:
- ✅ Supports virtually **any** smart light brand
- ✅ Advanced automation and control
- ✅ Single interface for all smart devices
- ✅ Local network control
- ✅ Powerful scene and script support

#### Limitations:
- ⚠️ Requires Home Assistant setup and maintenance
- ⚠️ Additional hardware recommended (Raspberry Pi, NUC, etc.)

---

### 4. **LAN Discovery** (Automatic for Native Protocols)
The app automatically discovers devices on your local network via mDNS/Bonjour:

#### Currently Scanned Service Types:
- `_govee._tcp.` - Govee devices
- `_wled._tcp.` - WLED controllers  
- `_hap._tcp.` - HomeKit devices (including Hue Bridge)
- `_lifx._tcp.` - LIFX lights
- `_http._tcp.` - Generic HTTP-based lights

#### Manufacturers with Native LAN Support:
- ✅ Govee (full native support)
- ✅ WLED (REST API implemented)
- ✅ Philips Hue Bridge (native API implemented)
- ⚠️ LIFX (partial LAN protocol - work in progress)

#### How to Enable:
1. Open Govee Mac Settings
2. Enable "Prefer LAN when available"
3. Click Refresh to discover devices
4. Discovered devices show their transport badge (WLED, Hue, LIFX, LAN)

#### Limitations:
- ⚠️ LIFX LAN protocol requires UDP binary protocol (HTTP API preferred)
- ⚠️ Not all devices broadcast mDNS
- ⚠️ Hue Bridge requires link button press for initial API key generation

## 🔧 Native Philips Hue Bridge API Support (✅ IMPLEMENTED)

### Features
Native Hue Bridge API support provides:
- ✅ Direct control without HomeKit or HA
- ✅ Automatic bridge discovery via Hue cloud and mDNS
- ✅ Full light control (power, brightness, color, color temperature)
- ⚠️ Scenes and entertainment mode (future enhancement)

### How It Works

#### 1. Hue Bridge Discovery
```swift
struct HueDiscovery: DeviceDiscoveryProtocol {
    func refreshDevices() async throws -> [GoveeDevice] {
        // Discover Hue Bridges via SSDP or mDNS (_hue._tcp.)
        // Register application with bridge (button press required first time)
        // Get list of lights from bridge API
        // Convert to GoveeDevice format
    }
}
```

#### 2. Hue Control Protocol
```swift
struct HueControl: DeviceControlProtocol {
    let bridgeIP: String
    let apiKey: String
    
    func setPower(device: GoveeDevice, on: Bool) async throws {
        // PUT /api/{apiKey}/lights/{id}/state
        // {"on": true/false}
    }
    
    func setBrightness(device: GoveeDevice, value: Int) async throws {
        // PUT /api/{apiKey}/lights/{id}/state
        // {"bri": 0-254}
    }
    
    // ... other methods
}
```

#### 3. Add to TransportKind
```swift
enum TransportKind: String, Codable, Hashable {
    case cloud, lan, homeKit, homeAssistant, dmx, hue
}
```

#### 4. Integration Steps
1. User presses physical button on Hue Bridge
2. App discovers bridge and creates API key
3. Bridge IP and API key stored in Keychain
4. Lights discovered and added to device list
5. Control commands sent via Hue API v2

## 💡 Tips

### Naming Conventions
When using Home Assistant, ensure your light entities have recognizable names:
- Good: `light.hue_living_room`, `light.philips_bedroom`
- Avoid: `light.light_1`, `light.device_abc123`

The app searches for common manufacturer names in entity IDs and friendly names.

### Multiple Integration Methods
You can use multiple methods simultaneously:
- HomeKit for some devices
- Home Assistant for others
- Govee Cloud API for Govee devices
- All devices appear in one unified interface!

### Network Requirements
- All methods work on **local network** (no internet required for control)
- Cloud APIs (Govee) require internet for discovery
- LAN and HomeKit are fully local

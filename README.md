## 🏗️ Architecture

### Transport Priority
The app intelligently routes commands based on availability:
1. **LAN** - Preferred (fastest, local network)
2. **HomeKit** - Native iOS/macOS integration
3. **Home Assistant** - Flexible automation platform
4. **Cloud** - Govee official API (reliable fallback)

## 💭 Developer Note

I'm sorry for not using the latest Xcode and Swift versions in this project. I can't afford a new Mac right now, so I'm working with what I have. The app is built with Xcode 15.2 and Swift 5.0, which are slightly older than the latest releases, but everything still works great! If you have a newer setup, feel free to upgrade the project settings—it should be compatible.

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- **LAN Discovery**: Not all Govee devices support LAN control
- **HomeKit**: Requires Matter-compatible Govee devices
- **Free Apple ID**: App can only run on your own Mac (not distributable)
- **Widget**: Requires manual Xcode target setup (see `WIDGET_SETUP.md`)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### LAN Discovery Not Finding Devices
- Ensure devices are on the same network
- Check firewall settings
- Use manual "Add Device" with IP address

### HomeKit Permission Denied
- Check System Settings → Privacy → HomeKit
- Re-enable in app Settings

### Widget Not Updating
- Verify App Groups entitlement: `group.com.govee.mac`
- Check Notification Center permissions

### API Rate Limits
- Govee Cloud API: 60 requests/minute
- Use LAN control for frequent updates

# Govee Mac - Complete Feature Implementation

## 🎉 All Requested Features Implemented!

## Recent App Status

The codebase has moved beyond the earlier prototype state in a few important areas:

- Device persistence now restores cached devices on launch.
- Settings persistence was hardened, and sensitive tokens are no longer kept only in plain `UserDefaults`.
- LAN discovery and LAN control were reworked for supported Govee LAN devices.
- HomeKit wording was corrected to reflect support for non-Matter HomeKit lights.
- The settings window now uses a more native macOS preferences-style layout.
- Touch Bar support was added and refined with custom controls for brightness, color temperature, and color.
- The default macOS color picker was replaced by custom in-app and Touch Bar color controls.
- Saved color presets now persist across launches.
- Unit test coverage was expanded around persistence-related behavior.

## 🌟 Multi-Manufacturer Support

The app supports controlling smart lights from **multiple manufacturers**:

### ✅ Directly Supported
- **Govee** - Native Cloud API and LAN protocol
- **Philips Hue** - Native Hue Bridge API, HomeKit, or Home Assistant
- **LIFX** - Via HomeKit or Home Assistant
- **Nanoleaf** - Via HomeKit
- **TP-Link Kasa/Tapo** - Via Home Assistant
- **Yeelight** - Via Home Assistant
- **WLED** - Native REST API or Home Assistant
- **100+ Other Brands** - Via Home Assistant

See [MANUFACTURER_INTEGRATION.md](MANUFACTURER_INTEGRATION.md) for complete integration guide.

Native Hue Bridge control and direct WLED REST control work without HomeKit or Home Assistant when configured, while HomeKit/HA remain available for broader multi-brand support.

### ✅ 1. LAN Auto-Discovery
**Implementation:** `GoveeModels.swift` - `LANDiscovery` and LAN control path
- Discovers supported Govee LAN devices on the local network
- Uses the app's current LAN discovery/control flow instead of the earlier unstable generic Bonjour scan
- Adds devices with LAN-capable transports and prefers local control when available
- Designed to keep the app responsive during startup and manual scans

**How it works:**
- Enable "Prefer LAN when available" in Settings
- Run LAN discovery from Settings or Add Device
- Discovered devices will show "LAN" badge in the UI
- LAN control is preferred when available (faster than Cloud)

### ✅ 2. HomeKit Integration (Supports Multiple Manufacturers)
**Implementation:** `GoveeModels.swift` - `HomeKitManager` and `HomeKitControl`
- Full HomeKit device support, including non-Matter lights
- Discovers **any** HomeKit-compatible smart light (not just Govee)
- Works with Philips Hue, LIFX, Nanoleaf, Eve, Meross, and more
- Reads characteristics: power, brightness, hue/saturation, color temperature
- Writes values back to HomeKit accessories
- RGB to HSV conversion for color control

**How to enable:**
1. First add your lights to the **Home** app (any HomeKit-compatible brand)
2. In Govee Mac: Settings → Enable HomeKit lights
3. Grant HomeKit permission when prompted
4. **All** your HomeKit lights will appear with "HomeKit" badge

**Entitlements added:**
- `com.apple.developer.homekit` - Required for HomeKit access
- Usage description added to Info.plist

### ✅ 3. Home Assistant Integration (Universal Manufacturer Support)
**Implementation:** `GoveeModels.swift` - `HomeAssistantDiscovery` and `HomeAssistantControl`
- Connects to your Home Assistant instance via REST API
- Discovers light entities containing common manufacturer names
- Works with **100+ integrations**: Hue, LIFX, Govee, TP-Link, Yeelight, Tuya, etc.
- Reads device state (on/off, brightness) from HA
- Calls light.turn_on/turn_off services
- Supports brightness_pct, rgb_color, color_temp (mireds conversion)

**Setup:**
1. Go to Settings
2. Enter your HA Base URL (e.g., `https://homeassistant.local:8123`)
3. Generate a Long-Lived Access Token in HA
4. Paste the token in Settings
5. Discovered HA devices will show "HA" badge

### ✅ 4. State Polling
**Implementation:** `GoveeController` - automatic polling task
- Polls all devices every 30 seconds
- Updates device state from all sources:
  - Cloud API (online status, capabilities)
  - Home Assistant (on/off, brightness values)
  - HomeKit (accessibility status)
  - LAN (when available)
- Optimistic updates: UI updates immediately when you control a device
- Background polling keeps state synchronized
- Task is cancelled on app termination

### ✅ 4a. Persistence and Restore
**Implementation:** `GoveeModels.swift` - `DeviceStore` and `SettingsStore`
- Cached devices are restored on launch
- Device mutations persist more consistently
- Settings storage supports testing and safer persistence behavior
- Home Assistant token handling was moved away from plain storage-only behavior

### ✅ 4b. Test Coverage Improvements
**Implementation:** `Govee MacTests/Govee_MacTests.swift`
- Added unit tests focused on persistence and restore behavior
- Covers cached device restore and settings persistence seams

**Behavior:**
- Starts automatically when app launches
- Runs in background using Swift structured concurrency
- Merges state from multiple sources intelligently
- Respects transport priority: LAN > HomeKit > HA > Cloud

### ✅ 5. Keychain Migration
**Implementation:** `APIKeyKeychain.swift` + `SettingsStore`
- Secure storage using macOS Keychain Services
- API key moved from UserDefaults to Keychain
- Automatic migration on first launch
- Uses `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock` for security

**Security improvements:**
- API key no longer stored in plain text
- Protected by macOS Keychain encryption
- Requires authentication to access
- Survives app uninstall/reinstall
- keychain-access-groups entitlement added

**Migration process:**
```swift
// On first launch:
1. Check UserDefaults for old API key
2. If found, save to Keychain
3. Remove from UserDefaults
4. All future reads/writes use Keychain
```

### ✅ 6. Menu Bar Icon
